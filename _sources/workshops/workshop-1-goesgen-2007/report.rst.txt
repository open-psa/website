Dear Colleagues,

The first "Next Generation PSA Software, Declarative Modeling, and Model Representation Standards Workshop"
was held at Kernkraftwerk Gösgen-Daeniken, Switzerland on June 12th.
We had 27 people attended and 9 presentations.
It was a full house and an enjoyable, long day.

Thanks to Dr. Jens Klugel for the wonderful pre-workshop dinner
and providing an excellent workshop venue.

The workshop attendees have made a first working group.
We will meet at Electricité de France in Paris on July 19
to begin a prototype of a Standard Representation Format for PSA Models.
Besides standard representations for models,
there was overwhelming consensus to create other working groups involved in:

- Data Visualization
- Dynamic PSA
- Declarative Modeling
- New calculation techniques, heuristics, and engines

Provisionally, we are calling ourselves the Open Initiative for Next Generation PSA Software.

The meeting in Paris is open to all.
If you would like to attend, please eMail me as soon as possible.

Here is a list of companies/groups
who will participate from Europe and Asia in the working group:

- EdF (July 19th meeting hosts)
- Gesellschaft für Anlagen-und Reaktorsicherheit
- Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH)
- AREVA
- AXPO/NOK
- BKW FMB
- KAERI
- KKL
- UTT
- PSI
- ABS Tokyo
- RISA
- RelconScandpower
- ABS Irvine
- Instituto de Investigacion
- IAEA (who will host the next meeting in Europe)
- ARBoost Technologies
- Tecnologica.Universidad Comillas Madrid
- Empresarios Agrupados
- KKG

During the summer,
we will work on this standard representation format prototype in Japan, Korea, and Europe.
As a result, we will hopefully have something substantial to present to the meeting in the US in autumn,
and add to this list of practitioners and researchers.
Dr. Antoine Rauzy is the leader of this group.

We will also try a test problem or two;
Ola Backstrom from RELCON, Woo Sik Jung from KAERI, and Olivier Nusbaumer from KKL, and myself will work on the details.

We are planning to have a second introductory workshop at the end of August in Asia, either in Japan or Korea.
We will keep you posted

The time and place for the US meeting will be finalized this week.
Again we will keep you posted.

I have attached the workshop agenda.
All of the presentations are available for your viewing.
Please send me a request for as many of the presentations as you would like.

Again, thank you all for your support and interest.

Steve Epstein
